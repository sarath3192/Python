    "| ⚠️ **Challenges**             | • Global state → hidden dependencies.<br>• Testing issues → hard to mock/reset.<br>• Concurrency risks → race conditions.<br>• Reduced flexibility → multiple instances hard to support later.<br>• Tight coupling → code tied to concrete global instance.<br>• Lifecycle control → tricky to manage creation/destruction.<br>• Violates SOLID → often breaks SRP & DIP. |\n",
    "| 📝 **Things to Keep in Mind** | • Use only for truly unique global resources (config, logger, event bus).<br>• Prefer Dependency Injection (DI) for most services.<br>• Make singleton resettable or mockable for tests.<br>• Ensure lazy initialization + thread safety.<br>• Keep focused — don’t overload with extra responsibilities.                                                                 |\n"
